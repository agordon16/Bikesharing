## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze New York City bikesharing data to ascertain if a similar program would succeed in Des Moines, IA.

## Results

### Checkout Times By Gender 
**This visualization shows that while most trip durations tend to be less than 40 minutes for most users, the majority of bikeshare users are male.**

### Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)
**When analyzing trip counts by gender and day/time of day use, males again dominate in usage particularly around workday start and end times.**

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
**Utilizing user data (subscribers to rideshare service versus single use customer) we can see the continued trend to male vs female and the majority of male users are subscribers rather than single use customers.**

### Starting and Ending Locations
**Reviewing location data indicates that most trips start and end in central New York City and Manhatten. Given the short duration of most rides, this could speak to the density of this particular section of the city and thus the need for better ways to traverse this area.**

### Trip Durations
**Gender not withstanding, trip durations trend towards being 40 minutes or less. This would seem to indicate that distances traveled are relatively short.**

### August Peak Hours
**Using starttime data, it appears most usage occurs during typical work start and end times. This could suggest that users are utilizing the bikeshare program to commute to and from the workplace.**

### Trips By Weekday per Hour
**Supporting the August peak time data, trips by weekday support trip time trends towards morning hours of 6:00 am - 9:00 am as well as 4:00 pm -8:00 pm. With less utilization in the mid portion of weekdays, this supports the theory that many users are using the program to commute to and from the workplace.

## Summary
Based on analysis of CitiBike data, the rideshare program is very successful in central New York City and Manhatten. Based on the mapping visualization, this area is not big but still utilizes the service quite substantially. If Des Moines, IA is similar in population density, this program could perform quite well. The next step in the overall analysis would be to look at similarities in city structure and population.
